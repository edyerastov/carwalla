<p><a name="privacy"></a><strong>Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:</p>
<p><strong>Information.</strong> You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your Personal Information during the past 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Access.</strong> You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion.</strong> You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.</p>
<p>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. We will also respond to requests for information and access only to the extent we are able to associate with a reasonable effort the information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in your request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.</p>
<p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p>

<p>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@lendingtree.com">mailto:<span>privacy@lendingtree.com</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Identity verification.</strong> The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request.  We will ask you to verify your identity when you submit a request.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized agents.</strong>California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf.  We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.</p>
